# Yelp Review Data Set from Kaggle.

Each observation in this dataset is a review of a particular business by a particular user.

The "stars" column is the number of stars (1 through 5) assigned by the reviewer to the business. (Higher stars is better.) In other words, it is the rating of the business by the person who wrote the review.
